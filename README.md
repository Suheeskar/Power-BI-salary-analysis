# Power-BI salary analysis

If an employee wants to get the highest salary possible, United States should be their choice. But of course, this analysis is purely based on the salaries. To give an answer to this, we should also analyze the cost of living, health-care, etc.

Large and mid-size companies are providing more salaries compared to small ones.

Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Machine Learning Engineers are the most valuable titles (by looking at their average salary).

Salary increase becomes drastic once you have gained a senior-level experience.

The majority of the data is based in the United States. Since the United States pays much higher wages than other countries, I don't believe these average salaries reflect reality. As a result, I would not base my expectations by looking at these average salaries.

After conducting this analysis, I believe that pursuing a data science related job is a good career choice in terms of salary and remote options.
